# Docking-Ligand-File-formatting-conversion
Automating Ligand Conversion – GitHub Repository This Python script automates the conversion of molecular ligand files between different formats using Open Babel. Developed by Dr. Fatima, it is designed for computational chemists and bioinformaticians involved in molecular docking and virtual screening.
Features
Batch Processing: Converts multiple ligand files at once based on an input list.
Flexible Format Support: Allows conversion between various molecular file formats such as .sdf, .pdbqt, and others supported by Open Babel.
3D Structure Generation: Uses Open Babel’s --gen3d flag to generate 3D molecular structures.
Error Handling: Provides basic error messages for troubleshooting installation and input issues.
Usage
Run the script using the following command:
python3 Automating_ligand_conversion.py input_file.txt input_format output_format
